# Ajohnnys-MtG-Workshop
Final FrontEnd Project Fall2020
A website that is meant to help new players of Magic: the Gathering (MTG) get learn the basics, by providing resources both from the games
creators, as well as local game shops here in Louisville, KY. The main page give info about what the game is, and where it came from, as well
as provides an anecdote and explaination about why I chose the name for the site. The local shops page provides links to shops I recommend around
town, as they have great selection, helpful staff, and a fun environment.

The 3 required features of this site are as follows:
1. A navigation menu that expands and collapses properly at desktop and mobile sizes, such as by switching between vertical and horizontal. Confirmed works.
2. Use Flexbox to organize content areas based on mobile or desktop views. Confirmed works.
3. Create a form (such as a ‘Contact Us’ form), validate at least 1 input (example, ensure email is in the proper format), and then use that information on your page somehow. Confirmed works. If text fields are blank, returns an error message and highlights non-valid field red. If all fields are
valid, a message returns, "${user.firstName} thanks for contacting us."
