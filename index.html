                <p>Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or just MTG)
                    is a collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield.
                    Released in 1993 by <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> 
                    (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first
                    trading card game and has approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018, 
                    and over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which
                    time it grew in popularity.</p>
                <p>Each game of Magic represents a battle between wizards known as 
                    'planeswalkers' who cast spells, use artifacts, and summon creatures as depicted on individual
                    cards in order to defeat their opponents, typically, but not always, by draining them of their
                    20 starting life points in the standard format.</p>

                <h2 class="heading">Ways to Play the Game</h2>
                <p>There are three ways for beginners to start playing MTG, the classic tabletop cardgame,
                    <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena" target="_blank">MTG Arena</a>, and
                    <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo" target="_blank">MTG Online</a>. If you ever feel that
                    you
                    are
                    becoming
                    a master of MTG, then you can also play Magic <a href="https://magic.gg/"
                        target="_blank">competitively</a>.
                    The tabletop game can be purchased at just about any store that sells games, or odered online at
                    any major retailer.

            <div>
                <p>My name is Johnny, and Ajani Goldmane is one of my all time favorite Magic characters. Not
                    only is he a really awesome part of the mythos, his name is also pronounced like mine
                    (A-johnny).
                    When I'm playing with my friends and any of us cast an Ajani, we all joke about it, and it's a
                    goofy, fun part of our MTG game. Being goofy and fun should be at the core of any friendly match
                    of MTG.

            <div>
                <p> This site is meant to help new Magic players learn more about Magic, as well as increase
                    the fun and convenience factor while playing the game.

            <div>
                <p>Many cards in MTG require single or multiple dice rolls. It's also convenient to decide who 
                    goes first, or who to attack or spare with a roll of the dice. To that end, I've included a 
                    dice roller to help.
