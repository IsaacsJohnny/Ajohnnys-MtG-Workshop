    <h2>What is MTG?</h2>
    <p>Magic: The Gathering (colloquially known as Magic or just MTG) 
        is a collectible and digital collectible card game created by Richard Garfield. 
        Released in 1993 by <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en" target="_blank">Wizards of the Coast</a> 
        (now a subsidiary of Hasbro), Magic was the first 
        trading card game and has approximately thirty-five million players as of December 2018, 
        and over twenty billion Magic cards produced in the period from 2008 to 2016, during which 
        time it grew in popularity.</p>
        <p>Each game of Magic represents a battle between wizards known as 
            'planeswalkers' who cast spells, use artifacts, and summon creatures as depicted on individual 
            cards in order to defeat their opponents, typically, but not always, by draining them of their 
            20 starting life points in the standard format.</p>
    <h2>Ways to Play the Game</h2>
    <p>There are three ways for beginners to start playing MTG, the classic tabletop cardgame, 
        <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena" target="_blank">MTG Arena</a>, and 
        <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgo" target="_blank">MTG Online</a>. If you ever feel that you are becoming

        The tabletop game can be purchased at just about any store that sells games, or odered online at
