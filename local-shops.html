                <div><p>The Lousiville Game Shop, was the first game store I ever visited here in Louisville.
                    The owner is a really cool guy, he's very helpful, and can get you anything that you need
                    to start playing! Be sure and stop on in and say hi. You can check out their website

                <div><p>If you have a desire for any and everything Magic related (and just about anything else
                    for that matter), then head on over to The Destination-Games, Toys, & Comics. There's 
                    nothing you can't find, or they can't order for you. This is a great little shop to visit
