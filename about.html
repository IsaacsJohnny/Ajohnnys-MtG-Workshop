        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>This site is meant to help new Magic players learn more about Magic, as well as increase
            the fun and convenience factor as the game can seem overwhelming at first. There are also
            features here for the experienced player, like the random dice roll simulator and life counter
            to make playing the game on tabletop a more streamlined process.
