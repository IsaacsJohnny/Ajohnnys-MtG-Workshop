            <p>My name is Johnny, and Ajani Goldmane is one of my all time favorite Magic characters. Not
                only is he a really awesome part of the mythos, his name is also pronounced like mine
                (A-johnny).
                When I'm playing with my friends and any of us play an Ajani, we all joke about it, and it's a
                goofy, fun part of our MTG game. Being goofy and fun should be at the core of any friendly match
                of MTG.
            </p>
            <p>This site is meant to help new Magic players learn more about Magic, as well as increase
                the fun and convenience factor as the game can seem overwhelming at first. There are also
                features here for the experienced player, like the random dice roll simulator and life counter
                to make playing the game on tabletop a more streamlined process.
